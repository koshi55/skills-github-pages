# My Travel to Hokkaido

## Introduction
In June 2024, I had the opportunity to visit Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. Known for its beautiful landscapes, delicious food, and rich culture, Hokkaido was a destination that I had always wanted to explore. This blog post is a quick draft of my travel experiences, and I plan to add more details and photos later.

## Day 1: Arrival in Sapporo
I arrived in Sapporo, the capital city of Hokkaido, in the afternoon. After checking into my hotel, I decided to explore the city. My first stop was Odori Park, a beautiful green space in the heart of Sapporo. The weather was perfect, and I enjoyed a relaxing walk, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.
